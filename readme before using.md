you must love penguins and the month february to use this mod. clearly state in chat: "I love febmod!"

about documentation: there currently is none and no guides are made yet (1 in the works), feb is working hard to make features and febmod be worth using. essentially, it's a free client with other mods such as rdbt and fh combined into one with bugfixes.



"I LOVE FEBMOD!"
